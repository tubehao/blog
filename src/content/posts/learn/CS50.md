# relocate

- C comes with a very useful function
  called `realloc` that will reallocate the memory for
  you. `realloc` takes two arguments. First, it asks you to
  specify the array you are attempting to copy. Second, it asks you to
  specify the size to which you would like the final array to be. Modify
  your code as follows:
  
    ```
    // Implements a list of numbers with an array of dynamic size using realloc
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    int main(void)
    {
        // List of size 3
        int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
        if (list == NULL)
        {
            return 1;
        }
    
        // Initialize list of size 3 with numbers
        list[0] = 1;
        list[1] = 2;
        list[2] = 3;
    
        // Resize list to be of size 4
        int *tmp = realloc(list, 4 * sizeof(int));
        if (tmp == NULL)
        {
            free(list);
            return 1;
        }
        list = tmp;
    
        // Add number to list
        list[3] = 4;
    
        // Print list
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        {
            printf("%i\n", list[i]);
        }
    
        // Free list
        free(list);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
  
    Notice
    that `int *tmp = realloc(list, 4 * sizeof(int))` creates a
    list of size four integers. Then, it copies the values
    of `list` to this new array. Finally, a pointer
    called `tmp` points to the location of memory of this new
    array. The copying is handled by `realloc`. Once that copy is
    made, the memory at the location of `list` is freed. Then,
    the pointer called `list` is pointed at the location
    of `tmp`, where the new array is located.
  
- You can imagine how using `realloc` for a queue or
stack could be useful. As the amount of data
grows, `realloc` could be used to grow or shrink the stack or
queue.
